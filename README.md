Utilities for managing multi-shot conversations and structured data handling in LLM applications

This repo contains shared, production-focused helpers we use at **Mighty Data Inc.** for building reliable LLM applications without rewriting the same plumbing in every project.

## Design goals

* Minimal abstractions
* Predictable behavior
* Cross-language parity (Python + TypeScript)
* Easy to drop into real projects

This is not a framework — just a clean, reusable toolkit for the parts of LLM integration that tend to get copy-pasted everywhere.
